A repository of me playing with Java.

The code does not necessarily belong to me as I copy and paste it from tutorials and stuff.

However, there is nothing rocket-sciency in the code either.

One particular github User that I stalk, and borrow code from is: https://github.com/kousen

I will create a proper list of attribution if/when I have time.

In the meantime, if you see your code here, and if you want attribution to your beloved for loop, or lambda usage, or inner class etc, just send me an email at me@volkan.io and I’ll add it to somewhere within this README.

Sorry for the mess; this repository is targeted for **my** learning; I’m not following any structure and/or pedagocial form.

Like, I’m dropping code just in case someone may find useful.

May the source be with you.

Volkan.
